# Abley Map Application

[Live Demo](https://aliakbarsu.github.io/AliakbarSu.github.io.ableyMap/)

## How to run this project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Head over to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Achievments

- The web page has a header component to navigate between different pages
- Footer section displays the copyright details
- The Map view has different layers that you can switch between
- You can toggle on and off the feature layer on the map

## Challenges

- Lack of good documentation for using the arcgis library
- Wasn't able to find the basemap specific name for different basemaps

## Improvements for production version

The current map view is not responsive enough so for the production version I would probabbly make it more responsive using mobile first approach.
